Description: In the context of Gaussian linear models, the package proposes a solution of the variable selection problem 
            using Shrinkage priors. The approach is based on first obtaining a posterior 
              distribution of the number of significant variables by clustering the significant variables and 
              the noise coefficients and obtaining samples from this distribution using MCMC. 
              Then, the significant variables are estimated from the posterior median. This approach requires 
              very few tuning parameters and is applicable to continuous shrinkage priors.
