Description: Variable Selection using Shrinkage Priors is Bayesian variable selection method using shrinkage priors to identify significant variables in high-dimensional datasets. The package includes methods for determining the number of significant variables through innovative clustering techniques of posterior distributions, specifically utilizing the 2-Means and Sequential 2-Means (S2M) approaches. The package aims to simplify the variable selection process with minimal tuning required in statistical analysis.
